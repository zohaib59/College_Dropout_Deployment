# College Dropout Prediction App

Just Launched: College Dropout Prediction App using XGBoost & Streamlit!

Excited to share a new project where I built an end-to-end machine learning web app that predicts student dropout risk based on academic, financial, and behavioral data.

Model Used: XGBoost
Features: Age, GPA, SAT, Income, Engagement, and more
Tools: Streamlit, scikit-learn, pandas, Python

Whether you're in education analytics, a data science learner, or just curious about ML deployment, check it out!

This Streamlit web application uses a machine learning model to predict whether a student is likely to **drop out** or continue based on their academic,
financial, and engagement-related data. The best-performing model used in this project is **XGBoost**.

## Model Details

- Algorithm: **XGBoostClassifier**
- Feature Scaling: **StandardScaler**
- Categorical Encoding: **LabelEncoder**
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
